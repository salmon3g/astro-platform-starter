## An Interesting Festival

有趣的节日

The Agricultural Feast takes place after the Independence Day. It is not a worldwide celebration. Only Christians in Mexico look forward to its arrival for its religious origin:

Long ago, humans’ ancestors were bad. They fooled and played tricks on each other and never kept their word. So God turned up and drowned all their crops. Humans starved day and night, weeping. In order to gain God’s forgiveness, a woman poet set off to see God. She admired God and kept apologizing. God was moved. With his permission, humans finally had good harvests again. So, to wipe sadness and remind themselves of the belief in God, people began the festival.

On the festival, people gather in open air, such as playgrounds or parking lots, and energetically have fun with each other all night long, as though they were never tired. When a beauty dressed up in lovely clothing reads poems in memory of the poet, everyone holds their breath. Then, it is the custom that the bone of a rooster head is given to her as an award.

Obviously, the story is not true, but the festival is interesting.

农业盛会在独立日后举行。它不是一个世界性的庆典，由于它的宗教起源，只有墨西哥的基督徒才盼着节日的到来：

很久以前，人类的祖先很坏，他们互相欺骗，耍诡计，从不遵守诺言。于是，上帝出现了，淹死了他们所有的作物。人们日夜挨饿，哭泣着。为了获得上帝的原谅，一位女诗人出发去见上帝。她对上帝的赞美和怀有的歉意感动了上帝，有了他的允许，人类终于又获得了丰收。因此，为了抹去忧伤并提醒自己对上帝的信仰，人们开始举办这个节日。

在节日那天，人们聚集在露天场所，例如操场或停车场，通宵达旦地玩得非常开心，精力充沛的人们似乎不知疲倦。当一位用可爱的衣服盛装打扮的美女朗读诗歌以纪念那位诗人时，在场的每个人都屏住了呼吸，然后，按照风俗，将奖励给她一只公鸡的头骨。

很明显，这个故事不是真的，但是节日却很有趣。

## Balanced Diet

平衡膳食

Wang Peng earned his living by running a barbecue restaurant, which served delicious bacon, fried chicken breast and mutton roasted with pepper and garlic. But his food and discount attracted fewer and fewer customers. Finally, he was in debt. Yong Hui’s slimming restaurant served fresh peas, carrots, eggplants, and raw cucumbers with vinegar. As the hostess, she said fibres benefited customers' digestion the most. In order not to let Yong Hui get away with telling

lies, Wang Peng spied on Yong Hui despite her glare. But he was surprised that she was losing her customers, too.

Curiosity drove Wang Peng to consult an expert. The expert sighed and said, “Both of your menus have weakness and limited strength. Your customers put on weight too easily, while Yong Hui’s lose weight too quickly. So, Wang Peng, cut down the fat of your food and increase vegetables and fruits, like nuts, beans, mushrooms, peaches and lemons. You ought to combine the two menus and provide a balanced diet.”

Before long, Wang Peng won his customers back.

王鹏经营一家烧烤餐厅来谋生，他的餐厅供应美味的腊肉、油炸的鸡胸，还有用辣椒和大蒜一起烤制的羊肉。但是，他的食物和折扣吸引的顾客越来越少，最后是他负债累累。永慧的减肥餐厅供应的是新鲜的豌豆、红萝卜、茄子和醋腌的生黄瓜。作为老板娘（女主人），她总是说食物纤维才最有利于顾客的消化。为了不让永慧说了谎不受惩罚，王鹏不顾她的怒视，前去探查个究竟。但是让他惊奇的是，永慧的顾客也在严重地流失。

好奇心驱使王鹏去咨询专家。那位专家叹息着说：“你们俩的菜单都缺点明显、优点有限。你的顾客很容易就发胖，而永慧的顾客体重却减轻得太快。所以嘛，王鹏，你要减少你的食物中的脂肪含量，增加蔬菜和水果，例如坚果、豆类、蘑菇、桃子和柠檬之类。你应该把两份菜单结合起来，给顾客提供平衡的膳食。”

不久，王鹏就赢回了他的顾客。

## Sailing Home

划船回家

This novel was about an unbelievable but genuine adventure. Its author was a black businessman who was brought up in America. In 1956, he visited Africa, his birthplace. One day, when he was wandering on the pavement near the bay enjoying the sea scenes, he lost his money and passport that he kept in an envelope. So he went to the embassy to seek help, but the ambassador with rude manners didn’t permit his staff to help though he bowed to him. Staring at his impatient face, he understood that it was the fault of his skin colour that accounted for their refection. So he decided to take a chance to sail on a small boat home.

He met a large amount of difficulty but was never stopped. On the contrary, difficulty pushed him to go ahead harder. Three months later, he was spotted by a ship by accident. He was in rags indeed. A maid even screamed when bringing him a steak and pineapple dessert. Aboard, he earned his passage by working as a barber and got home finally. As for the name of his novel, he couldn’t think of a better one than the phrase “Go Ahead”.

这部小说写的是一次令人难以置信而又真实的历险。其作者是一位在美国被抚养长大的黑人商人。1956年，他回到他的出生地非洲。有一天，当他在海湾边的人行道上漫步欣赏海景时，他丢失了一个装着钱和护照的信封，于是向当地的大使馆寻求帮助。但是大使态度非常粗鲁，即使向他鞠躬，也不允许他的职员帮忙。盯着他那不耐烦的脸，他知道是他皮肤颜色的错才导致了他们的拒绝。于是，他决定冒险驾驶一只小船回家。

他遇到了许多困难，但是从未停止，相反，困难推动他更努力地前进。三个月后，当他被一艘船偶然发现时，真的是衣衫褴褛。给他端来牛排和菠萝甜品的女仆甚至被吓得尖叫起来。在船上，他当一名理发师来挣取船费，最后终于回到了家。至于这部小说的名字，他再也不能想到一个比“前进”更好的短语了。

## Explore MKII

探测MKII行星

MKII, a planet billions of kilometers away, is the origin of life in many religions. Physicists have proved the theory that its gentle climate and the pull of its gravity are similar to the earth’s. And astronomers have found that oxygen atoms and carbon dioxide, which are fundamental to life, exist in its atmosphere through satellites. Cheered up by this news, biologists, in their turn, began to do some research to remove people’s puzzles—Now that there are some suitable conditions, does life really exist on this globe? Do they multiply by laying eggs or giving birth to babies?

Last month, a spaceship was sent there. It’s a pity that this mission failed. Unlike the earth, MKII is a much younger planet. Thus, masses of harmful acid clouds float everywhere causing violent chain reactions to break out. These clouds not only blocked out the pilots’ sight but also damaged the engine system. Luckily, the pilots watched out carefully and prevented the spaceship from crashing in time.

MK二号是一颗几十亿公里外的行星，它在许多宗教里都是生命起源的地方。物理学家已经证明了它温和的气候和重力的牵引都和地球相似的理论；天文学家也通过卫星，在它的大气层里发现了氧原子和二氧化碳的存在，这些都是对生命来说，都是基本的。受到这一消息的鼓舞，生物学家们接着开始了研究以解开人们的迷惑——既然有了适合的条件，生命真的存在于这个星球吗？他们是通过下蛋，还是产仔来繁殖后代的呢？

上个月，一艘太空飞船被派到了那儿。可惜的是，这次任务失败了。不像地球，MK二号是一颗年轻得多的行星。因此，大团大团的有害酸云到处漂浮，引起猛烈的连锁反应的爆发。这些云团不仅阻挡了飞行员的视线，而且还损坏了发动机系统。幸运的是，飞行员小心注意，才及时阻止了飞船的坠毁。

## A Journey across Canada

横穿加拿大的旅行

After a quiz last autumn, Kuang crossed the continent eastward to Toronto to visit his schoolmate, the distance measuring approximately 5,000 kilometers,

His train started from Vancouver, a city surrounded by mountains. After confirming his baggage was aboard the train, Kuang settled down in his seat. Having a gift for communication, he started chatting with another passenger within 5 minutes. Their topics included the Canadian traditions, the Prime Minister, the mixture of races, and the terrifying Great Fall. After a nice buffet at noon, he was pleased to find that the scenery was impressive. He saw beautiful harbours in the distance, wealthy urban areas and maple forest that covered thousands of acres. He even managed to catch sight of an eagle flying upward over bushes.

Kuang reached Toronto which lies slightly near the border at a misty dawn. There was frost and the broad downtown streets were very quiet. Though it was early, Kuang phoned his schoolmate in a booth nearby at once rather than waiting for him to come. They had a good time together.

去年秋天的一次考试后，光向东横穿整个大陆，来到多伦多探望他的同学，这次旅行的距离测量起来大约有五千多公里。

他的火车从群山围绕的温哥华启程。在证实了自己的行李都在火车上之后，光就在座位上安坐下来。因为在与人交流方面有天赋，他在5分钟内就和另一个乘客聊起天来。他们的话题包括加拿大的传统、加拿大的总理、种族的混合，还有让人心惊胆战的大瀑布。中午吃了一顿美味的自助餐后，他很高兴发现外面的风景非常让人印象深刻。他看见了远处美丽的海港、富裕的市区，还有延绵几千亩的枫树林，他甚至还设法看见了一只在灌木丛上空翱翔的鹰。

光在一个薄雾笼罩的黎明到达稍稍接近边境的多伦多，地上有霜，宽阔的市区街道很安静。尽管还很早，光却不愿等待，立刻就在附近电话亭给同学打了个电话。他们在一起度过了美好的时光。

## A Woman Doctor - Lina

女医生丽娜

Born in a pigs’ nest, Lina led a poor life in her childhood. She was looked down upon by the children of her generation. But she intended to become a doctor after she came across Lin Qiaozhi by chance, who was delivering medical courses to an audience crowding around her. Before moving off, Lin inspired her to carry on her study. With Lin’s support, Lina entered an institute and studied hard sparing no time for entertainment. Her being outspoken and modest won respect for her. Her excellent arguing skills and observation ability put others into the shade.

Now, Lina has become a specialist in human beings’ emergency sickness. Her kindness and considerate behavior to the poor were well known. The organization she founded carried out campaigns and welfare projects to help cut the death rate for the poor. Her job was hard but worthwhile. She often refers to the connection between her achievement and Lin Qiaozhi, and says that her poor childhood is the bond between her and the poor.

丽娜出生在猪圈里，童年过着贫穷的生活，被和她同辈的孩子看不起。但是在她偶然遇见了林巧芝之后却打定注意想要成为一名医生，当时林巧芝正在给拥挤在她身边的观众传授医疗课程，在离开之前，林巧芝鼓舞她继续坚持学习。在林的支持下，丽娜进入了一所学院。她努力学习，毫不浪费时间玩闹娱乐。她的坦诚和谦虚为她赢得了尊敬，她优秀的辩论技巧和观察能力使其他的人都黯然失色。

现在，丽娜已经成为一名人类紧急病症专家。她对穷人的好心和考虑周到的一举一动都众所周知，她建立的组织开展各种活动和福利项目来为穷人减少死亡率。她的工作艰苦却很值得。她常常提到她的成就和林巧芝之间的联系，还总是说她贫穷的童年就是她与穷人之间的纽带。

## A New Farming Way

新的耕种方式

Tuan was a farmer in Vietnam. For decades, he had been struggling to rid his family of hunger. However, it always confused him how to expand the output of his crops. This disturbing problem led to his regretting being a farmer. He would rather have chosen another job.

One day, when skimming through a newspaper, Tuan read a comment on Yuan Longpin. He underlined Yuan’s nationality and occupation, and then focused on his discovery and the statistics of his research. He found the knowledge Yuan circulated very practical. Therefore, he made a summary and began to build up a new farming method. He planted super grain of rich nutrition and equipped himself to keep his crops roots free from bacteria and pests. He also enriched minerals in the soil while reducing chemical fertilizers. Though it cost him more time and freedom, he was full of hope.

The next year, Tuan was sunburnt but satisfied with his production very much. Thanks to Yuan Longpin, he not only won the battle against hunger, but he could also export his crops abroad.

俊是一名越南的农民，几十年来，他都一直在努力使家人摆脱饥饿。然而，如何扩大他的农作物产量这一问题却一直在困扰着他。这个恼人的问题导致了他后悔当一名农民，而宁愿自己当初选择其它的工作。

一天，俊在浏览报纸的时候，读到一篇关于袁隆平的评论。他在袁的国籍和职业下面划了线，然后将焦点集中在他的发现和研究数据上。他发现袁传播的知识非常实用，因此，他做了摘要，并开始建立一种新的耕作方式。他种植营养丰富的超级谷物，添置设备以使作物的根部免受细菌害虫的伤害；他还增加土壤所含的矿物质，同时减少化学肥料的使用。尽管耗费了他更多的时间和自由，他却充满着希望。

第二年，俊被晒黑了，但是却对自己的生产非常满意。多亏了袁隆平，他不仅赢得了对抗饥饿的战斗，而且还将自己的作物出口到国外呢。

## Chaplin - A Great Master of Humour

幽默大师卓别林

Chaplin was an extraordinary performer who starred in and directed many outstanding comedies. Few were bored watching his moustache, his gestures or his entertaining reactions when chased by detectives. Being drunk, sliding on a banana skin or whispering his own failures to nobody, he made us feel more content with our life without any verbal explanation. His particular sense of humor has astonished everybody throughout the world up to now.

In a small budget film, he played a badly-off and homeless person wearing worn-out shoes and messy clothes. On one occasion, he was trapped by a snowstorm in a vast mountainous area. Though he overcame many difficulties, he wasn’t fortunate enough. With all the porridge eaten up, he picked out a shoe and boiled it to eat. He cut off the leather bottom and chewed it like a pancake. According to an actress, his acting was so convincing and amusing that everybody couldn’t help bursting into laughter.

卓别林是一名非凡的演员，他主演并导演了多部杰出的喜剧。看见他可笑的小胡子、滑稽的手势动作，还有面对警探的追捕时有趣的反应，很少有人会觉得厌烦。喝醉酒啦，踩到香蕉皮滑倒啦，或者自言自语（低语）自己的糗事啦，他无需任何语言解释的表演总是使我们对自己的生活感到更加满意。他独特的幽默感直到现在依然使世界各地的人们都感到惊讶。

在一部小预算的电影里，他穿着磨破的鞋子和脏兮兮的衣服，扮演了一名贫穷又无家可归的人。在一幕场景中，他被一场暴风雪困在一片多山的区里。尽管他克服了许多困难，但是他还是运气不好的。粥都吃完了，他只好挑出一只鞋子煮来吃。他切下皮革的鞋底，像烙饼一样地咀嚼起来。据一名女演员所说，他的表演是如此地令人信服而又逗人发笑的，以致在场的所有人都忍不住大笑起来。

## A Misunderstanding

一场误会

In general, spoken statements are the major way of communication, but body language and facial expressions also have such kinds of function. For example, yawning means being not interested and turning one’s back to someone or swinging your fist shows your anger. But what those gestures really mean is subjective in different cultures. Thus, misunderstandings happen now and then in today’s world of cultural crossroads.

Once, representing the Adults’ Education Association, I went to the airport to meet an official of high rank from Columbia and take him to his dormitory and then to the canteen. After the flight arrived, I saw a man looking around curiously. So I approached to greet him. He suddenly dashed to hug me and kissed me on both cheeks. As a young girl, I felt truly embarrassed and put up my hands to defend myself. His false smile told me that he had lost face.

Later, I received a cassette from him, in which he recorded his apology. On hearing that Columbians were more likely to kiss others, I soon felt at ease.

通常说来，口头表达是人们交流的主要方法，但是肢体语言和面部表情也有这种功能。例如，打哈欠意味着不感兴趣，背对别人或向其挥舞拳头表达的是愤怒。但是在不同的文化中那些手势表达的真正意思是很主观的。由此，误会就时不时地发生在今天这个文化交叉碰撞的世界里。

有一回，我代表成人教育协会到机场去接一位从哥伦比亚来的高级官员，我得带他到宿舍和食堂。当他的航班到达时，我看见一名男子好奇地东张西望，于是走上前去和他打招呼。他突然猛冲过来拥抱我，还亲了我的脸颊。还是个年轻姑娘的我感到真尴尬，不由自主举起手来保护自己。他的假笑告诉我他感到丢了面子。

后来，我收到他送来的一盒磁带，里面录了他的道歉。当听到这只是因为哥伦比亚人更倾向于见面时互相亲吻时，我很快就感到轻松安心了。

## A Unique Theme Park

独一无二的主题公园

As soon as our shuttle got close to the theme park by the freeway, everyone came to life and put on cloth sneakers in advance for an outing. Our translator paid for the admission, and we started enjoying the various attractions in the sunlight.

According to the travel brochure, this unique park is famous for its well preserved minority culture. We experienced many deeds of the early settlers, such as swinging across rivers, hunting creatures in the jungle, or taking part in swords fighting tournaments.

This park is also famous for its wooden souvenirs. Whichever we bought in the central shop was made of wood, and wherever we went we could see minority carpenters working. They made wooden tools, wooden cartoon figures, wooden athletic products and so on. They even built a huge wooden engine with a length of 20 metres, which was modeled after a real one.

This theme park is really a fantasy amusement park. No wonder it has become the brand of local tourism.

我们走高速公路的来往穿梭巴士一接近主题公园，大家都活跃了起来，并且提前穿上了布鞋，做好这趟外出旅游的准备。翻译付了入场费后，我们就开始在阳光下欣赏各种各样吸引人的东西。

根据旅行手册的介绍，这个独一无二的公园因其得到良好保护的少数名族文化而闻名。我们体验了许多早期定居者所做的事，如荡过河啦，在丛林中猎杀动物啦，或者参加剑术比赛啦等等。

这个公园还因为它的木制纪念品而闻名，我们在中心商场购买的任何一件物品，都是用木头制作的，无论我们走到哪里，都可以看见少数名族的木匠们在忙碌。他们制作的有木制工具、木制的卡通人物、木制的运动用的产品，等等等等。他们甚至还根据一台真实发动机仿造了一台长度有20米的木制发动机。

这个主题公园真是个充满幻想的娱乐公园，怪不得它成为当地旅游业的一个品牌。
